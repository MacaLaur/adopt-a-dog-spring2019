ADOPT A DOG

Adopting is the new buying. 

Our goal is to help hundreds of sweet animals in the greater Seattle, Bellevue, and Tacoma areas find their forever home. We want our customers to be able to view the dogs that are available for adoption and can see how much it might cost to adopt (not including shots, procedures, leash, toys, etc.). Our weekly updated blog also helps to keep the customer informed on tips and tricks on dog training and care as well as other helpful resources.
 
How it works:
Simply browse our site for the dogs that are available at a location near you. Each dog has a story, so take the time to read their profile, and really get to know them. Prices are labeled for each dog. Our selection of dogs is updated every month as we are always getting new rescues from surrounding states. Adopt a Dog provides a convenient online payment options for those who would like to plan ahead for their pick up date or those who don't want to be bothered with payment when they come in to get their new furry friend(s).
